Method userAmount1(int) is a direct process it takes request from user and returns money if available, where method userAmount2(int) takes requested amount from user and fullfills the user request by adding all kinds of denominations such that user recieves less number of denominations and at the same time user recieves minimum valued denominations(ex 100, 500) so that user can't find difficulty during exchange with others and ATM won't be exausted with any denomination easily.
